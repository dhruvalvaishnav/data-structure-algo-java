    Problem Statement: Given a start date and an end date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD",
    count how many Mondays, Tuesdays, etc., fall within that range. Return the weekday with the highest count as a string (e.g., "Monday").

    Example:

    Input: startDate = "2023-01-01", endDate = "2023-01-31"
    Output: "Monday" (assuming Mondays are the most frequent in that range)

    Constraints:
    The dates are guaranteed to be valid and the start date is before or equal to the end date.

    Implementation Steps:
    Parse the start and end dates.
    Iterate through each date in the range.
    Count the occurrences of each weekday.
    Determine which weekday has the highest count and return it.

Here are some practice questions similar to the one you worked on, focused on date processing, counting occurrences, and similar logic:

Count Weekdays in Date Range:
Given a start date and an end date, count how many Mondays, Tuesdays, etc., fall within that range. Return the weekday with the highest count.

Events by Quarter:
Given a list of dates, count how many events occurred in each quarter (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4) of the year. Return the quarter with the most events.

Frequency of Dates:
Given a list of dates, return the date that occurs most frequently. If thereâ€™s a tie, return the latest date.

Most Active Year:
Given a list of dates, determine which year has the highest number of events. Return that year as a string in "YYYY" format.

Monthly Average Events:
Given a list of dates, calculate the average number of events per month across all years. Return the month with the highest average.

Seasonal Events:
Given a list of dates, determine how many events occur in each season (spring, summer, fall, winter). Return the season with the most events.

Count Unique Dates:
Given a list of dates, return the number of unique dates that appear in the list.

Most Frequent Day of the Month:
Given a list of dates, find which day of the month (1-31) appears most frequently. Return it as a string (e.g., "01" for the 1st).

Find Events on Specific Day:
Given a list of dates and a specific day (e.g., "15"), count how many events occurred on that day of the month across all years.

Monthly Events Trend:
Given a list of dates, determine if the number of events is increasing, decreasing, or stable month-over-month.
Return a summary of the trend (e.g., "increasing", "decreasing", "stable").
